	<description>A general framework for magic systems in RimWorld. It offers a modular system that enables modders to easily design how magic works and is learned in-game. 
	
How does it work? It's sorcery! *roll credits*

Warmest thanks go to:
Gouda quiche, my C# mentor;
Fraudecon, for his input and wisdom;
Flango, for his contribution of skill trees to the learning system;
Feldoh, for his advice;
DetVisor, for his UI and preview art;
and many others!
